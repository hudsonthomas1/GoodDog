This is a program desgined to track and manage dogs in a dog boarding daycare system. It can manage conflicts between dogs who can't be on the same side (i.e near each other)
or dogs who can't even be risked in the same room. It reads this information stored through a text file and uses a GUI based system to allow dogs to be tracked as soon as they 
come in. It will prevent dogs from being added who present a risk to a dog already in daycare. It will also save all information everytime it is closed, so you will not 
lose all the dogs in daycare if you close the program out.
