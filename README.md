This is a program desgined to track and manage dogs in a dog boarding daycare system. It can manage conflicts between dogs who can't be on the same side (i.e near each other)
or dogs who can't even be risked on the same side. It reads this information stored through a text file and uses a GUI based system to allow dogs to be tracked as soon as they 
come in. It will prevent dogs from beeing added who present a risk to a dog already in daycare.
